        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>It was the 1950s, and upon the fall of the Berlin Walls, many 
victims of war were emancipated. However, such fate did not 
befall the orphans of Kinderheim orphanage in East Germany, 
who mysteriously disappeared in a fire.
Along with their disappearance was the director of the 
the orphanage, Name, the caretaker, ..., Name, the gardener.

Among the survivors, there was a girl called Anna. When asked 
about the event that transgressed the orphanage, she whispered, "I've seen Hell. Demons roamed the land, and dark flames sprung into life. People crying, screaming, dying... In the end, there was me and only me."
The whereabouts of the staff and the children remain unknown. However, in the chaotic state of the nation, such events were soon forgotten. Investigations were dropped, and it was as if the people within the orphanage never existed. </p>

        <h2>Start of the Game</h2>
        <p>"I keep on having the same dream. It's always the same place: the same desolate building, deprecated rooms, and peeling walls. The heavy smell of rust and iron seems to permeate from the floor. I do not know this place, yet it seemed so eerily familiar. Instinctively, I know I should be terrified of this place, but strangely, it felt like home."<br><br>

"I do not remember anything that happened before I was ten. My parents said that I lost all of my childhood memories because I was hit by a car when I was little, but I can't find a single trace of my young self. No childhood pictures, no baby clothes. I began suspecting that the dream was somehow connected to my past." <br><br>

"The same dream that has haunted me for years become more frequent and longer and longer. I fear I may not wake up from my dream one day."
